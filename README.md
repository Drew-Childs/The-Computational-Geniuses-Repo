# The-Computational-Geniuses-Repo


COVID-19 has impacted everybody differently. When given the prompt to address personal or business challenges during COVID-19, our team set out to solve as many of these challenges for as large of a demographic as possible. We first stepped back and asked ourselves what problems we have had during this pandemic and then reached out to others and asked the same question. Many responses included less income/job loss, less motivation, more time to try new things, boredom, and stress/uncertainty.

We then started brainstorming and came up with the idea for the Computational Cookbook, which addresses all the above issues. Regarding income, our solution helps to maximize every dollar by saving userâ€™s money by not eating out as often and still cooking delicious, affordable meals at home. Along with this, we figured our solution could help users become more motivated, as having a solid meal can really help to change your mood/attitude and turn your day around. Our solution also addresses the issues of more time, boredom, and stress by allowing users to be more creative and trying something they normally would not. In the process, it also helps to take their mind off of whatever is currently going on in their world and to escape from reality, even if it is only temporary.
